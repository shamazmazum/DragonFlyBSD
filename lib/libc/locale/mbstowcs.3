.In stdlib.h
.Ft size_t
.Fo mbstowcs
.Fa "wchar_t * restrict wcstring" "const char * restrict mbstring"
.Fa "size_t nwchars"
.Fc
.In xlocale.h

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mbstowcs
and
.Fn mbstowcs_l
functions convert a multibyte character string
.Fa mbstring
beginning in the initial conversion state
into a wide character string
.Fa wcstring .
No more than
.Fa nwchars
wide characters are stored.
A terminating null wide character is appended if there is room.
.Pp
The
.Fn mbstowcs_l
function takes an explicit
.Fa locale
argument, whereas the
.Fn mbstowcs
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn mbstowcs
and
.Fn mbstowcs_l
functions return the number of wide characters converted,
not counting any terminating null wide character, or \-1
if an invalid multibyte character was encountered.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn mbstowcs
and
.Fn mbstowcs_l
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
An invalid multibyte sequence was detected.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The conversion state is invalid.
