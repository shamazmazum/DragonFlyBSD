.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcstombs
and
.Fn wcstombs_l
functions convert a wide character string
.Fa wcstring
into a multibyte character string,
.Fa mbstring ,
beginning in the initial conversion state.
Up to
.Fa nbytes
bytes are stored in
.Fa mbstring .
Partial multibyte characters at the end of the string are not stored.
The multibyte character string is null terminated if there is room.
.Pp
The
.Fn wcstombs_l
function takes an explicit
.Fa locale
argument, whereas the
.Fn wcstombs
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcstombs
and
.Fn wcstombs_l
functions return the number of bytes converted
(not including any terminating null), if successful, otherwise they return
.Po Vt size_t Pc Ns \-1 .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn wcstombs
and
.Fn wcstombs_l
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
An invalid wide character was encountered.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The conversion state is invalid.
