.In libhammer.h
.Ft libhammer_fsinfo_t
.Fn libhammer_get_fsinfo "const char *path"
.Ft libhammer_pfsinfo_t
.Fn libhammer_get_first_pfs "libhammer_fsinfo_t fsinfo"

.Ft libhammer_pfsinfo_t
.Fn libhammer_get_next_pfs "libhammer_pfsinfo_t pfsinfo"

.Fn libhammer_get_prev_pfs "libhammer_pfsinfo_t pfsinfo"
.Ft void
.Fn libhammer_free_fsinfo "libhammer_fsinfo_t fsinfo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn libhammer_get_fsinfo
iterates all the PFSs from a given path belonging to a
.Nm HAMMER
file system and returns
.Vt libhammer_fsinfo_t
.Fa fsinfo
which holds a
.Nm TAILQ
of
.Vt libhammer_pfsinfo
structs, one per PFS found.
.Pp
The list of found PFSs can be iterated with
.Fn libhammer_get_first_pfs ,
.Fn libhammer_get_last_pfs ,
.Fn libhammer_get_next_pfs
and
.Fn libhammer_get_prev_pfs .
.Pp
Note that to use the next and previous functions described above you need
to store the returning
.Vt libhammer_pfsinfo_t
value from the first and last functions.
.Pp
.Fn libhammer_free_fsinfo
frees up all the resources allocated previously by
.Fn libhammer_get_fsinfo .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn libhammer_get_fsinfo
returns a
.Vt libhammer_fsinfo_t
in any case where path is in a
.Nm HAMMER
file system or
.Dv NULL
if there was any other problem.
You can check
.Nm errno
in the error cases.
.Pp
.Fn libhammer_get_first_pfs
and
.Fn libhammer_get_last_pfs
must return a
.Vt libhammer_pfs_t
if the
.Fa fsinfo
passed in is valid.
.Fn libhammer_get_next_pfs
and
.Fn libhammer_get_prev_pfs
return a
.Vt libhammer_pfsinfo_t
or
.Dv NULL
in case there are no more elements.
