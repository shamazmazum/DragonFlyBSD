DISCLAIMER:

This is a repository of DragonFlyBSD with my patches which were rejected by some
reason or even never sent to its developers, but I think which are good enough
to be forgotten. Since they are rejected, I no longer strictly follow their
style guide anymore, but will try to use the same code formatting when I choose
so.

This includes some improvements, stuff ported from FreeBSD, bugfixes and so on.
